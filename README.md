# Web-Design-Challenge

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contains visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

Use the below link to view the page
